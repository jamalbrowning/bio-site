            A 29 y/o Audio Engineer/House Flipper turned Web Developer. I have
            an expertise in smashed vocals, smashed burgers, smashed objects,
            and smashed keys. A full smash of skills!

            At this point I have only just begun my projected course to total
            coding but my core values that drive me towards that goala are
            Family, Community, Innovation, Creativity and Work/Life Balance.

          <p>
            the new skills I develop I hope to be able to help others and fuel
            the creative gene I have stoked my whole life. I have a always been
            keen to what goes on in the different worlds of coding and I'm
            excited for the next few decades doing it.

            are a few things that really catch my attention when it comes to
            LOVING developement, mainly it's the fact that it is constantly
            evolving and you have the chance to learn something new and create
            something new everyday.
